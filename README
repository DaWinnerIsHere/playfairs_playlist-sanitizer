# Playlist Sanitizer (Kills 99.9% of Duplicate Songs)

Hi there :3

# Setup

## Clone the Repository

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:playfairs/playlist-sanitizer.git
```

## cd into the directory

```Bash
cd playlist-sanitizer
```

## Create and Active a Virtual Environemnt

```Bash
python -m venv "venv"
source bin/venv/activate
```

### Or

```Bash
python3 -m venv "venv"
source bin/venv/activate
```

## Then install the requirements

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Or

```Bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Then run the script

```Bash
python src/main.py
```

### Or

```Bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## Once the script is running, go to your select playlist, paste the Playlist ID amd hit enter.

For the Playlist ID, copy the Playlist URL, then copy the array of numbers and letters after open.spotify.com/playlist/

For example

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3H02Sd7T8xo5I6w5mONk9F?si=cbfcec684f23452f

This Playlists ID is 3H02Sd7T8xo5I6w5mONk9F, so that's what you would paste into the terminal, and it would go from that.
